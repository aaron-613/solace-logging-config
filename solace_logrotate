# IMPORTANT!!  Make sure your username and group matches whatever rsyslog or 
# syslog-ng or whoever is creating the log files, otherwise it'll make them root,
# and then logigng will break if (e.g. user syslog) can't write to root file.
# And definitely 644 so other (regular) users can still see these files
create 644 syslog adm
#create 644 root root

# doesn't matter if there's some missing files for some reason

# to reattach to the new log files (otherwise they'll keep writing to the
# renamed .1 file)
