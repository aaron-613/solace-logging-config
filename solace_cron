# This cron determines how often the logs are checked to see if they need
# rotating, with sizes and such determined in the logrotate file.
#
# Copy this file into /etc/cron.d/
#  ** OR ** remove the "root" username below and use 'crontab -e' as root
#
# This will check every 2 minutes... probably every 5 minutes is good enough.
# Update the various filenames/paths if necessary.
