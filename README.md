# solace-logging-config

This is a collection of logging configuration files for use with Solace messaging routers.  Currently includes:

 - rsyslog
 - syslog-ng
 - logstash grok (ELK / ElasticSearch)
 
_These are very much WIP, and meant to give a Solace administrator a head-start on configuration._

The logstash grok rules are still really rough, but the rsyslog and syslog-ng rules are fairly complete.
They do roughly the same thing:

 - Listen on 3 different inbound TCP ports, one for dev, test, and prod
    - This way I could add additional rules/processing later on depending on what port it is
    - This assumes a particular Solace router is designated as prod, test, or dev.  Maybe change to prod/non-prod?
 - Ability to process all 3 log files arriving from Solace, but does some filtering
    - system.log: this is essentially left alone, but I think this log is dumb as it's a subset of event.log
    - command.log: all the commands, but filtering out all the 'show' commands (which can be exported to command via the CLI command 'en --> con --> logging command all mode all'.  Very useful for watching monitoring polling rate.
    - show.log: all of the show commands get put into a separate file to not junk up the command.log
    - event.log: all of the router's event logs, minus a couple AUTH logs that are constantly generated by SEMP monitoring apps

I have all 3 of these running concurrently on my local dev server, hence the port variations.

Divide the inbound ports into: dev, test, and prod.  This could allow for future variations in rules/processing.


I've also included an example logrotate configuration file, and a crontab entry to check every 5 minutes if the logs need rotating
