# This crontab entry determines how often the logs are checked to see if they need rotating,
# with sizes and such determined in the logrotate file.
#
# Use 'crontab -e' as root, and enter one of these lines as appopriate.
#  ** OR ** copy this file into /etc/cron.d/
#
# This will check every 2 minutes... probably every 5 minutes is good enough.
# Update the various filenames/paths if necessary.
